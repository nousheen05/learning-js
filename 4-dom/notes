1) When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page
2) The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects or nodes
3) JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

4) similar to css - where we select and apply the required effects


.....window and dom....
1) window object = browser api, which gives methods and properties
to work with browser
2) within the window object we have document object
3) no need of writing "window.document" as js always looks
into window object for all methods
4) document is an object itself with different properties
It represts HTML of our page 
5) console.dir(document) === to get all properties of document
